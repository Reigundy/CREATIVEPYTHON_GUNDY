## üìö Resources I'm Learning From

- [W3Schools Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
- Class materials + tutorials
- Messing around with examples and breaking them

---

## ‚úÖ Assignment 1: Set Up Your GitHub

**Prompt:**  
Create a GitHub repo to hold all your work for this class. Include a README to describe what this is, what you're learning from, and share an image (like a meme or artwork).

**Process:**  
Pretty much what you're looking at now. I set up the repo, structured the README, and started linking both my creative process and resources I‚Äôm drawing from.

‚úÖ *Done and done.*

## üé® Assignment 2: Recreate an Artwork with py5

**Prompt:**  
Choose an artwork you vibe with ‚Äî poster, pattern, portrait, etc. ‚Äî and try to recreate it using `py5`. You can use shapes like `ellipse()`, `rect()`, `triangle()`, etc. Add your own twist ‚Äî randomness, interactions, mouse input, whatever.

**Process:**  
I took a bold, abstract composition and rebuilt it using layered shapes and color. The piece includes:

- Arcs and ellipses mimicking facial structure and abstract forms  
- Triangles and rectangles for shape variation and geometry  
- Mouse interactions that affect small circle elements to give it life  

**Code:**

## üåÄ Assignment 3: Scroll Art Remix

**Prompt:**  
Pick a scroll art piece from [The Scroll Art Museum](https://scrollart.org/), study the code, and remix it by changing variables, characters, and conditionals. Try to understand what‚Äôs happening, mess it up, break it, and see what comes out the other side. Credit your source!

**Process:**  
I remixed the **Twists** scroll art piece by Al Sweigart. I started by reading the original code, then slowly made tweaks to see how each piece affected the visuals. I focused on shifting the spacing and speed of the twisting columns, tried to break the logic, and learned how each loop tied into the animation. It helped me understand how terminal-based animations can feel alive just through character shifts and timing.

**Modifications I made:**
- Changed the twist delay and spacing  
- Tweaked the math controlling the sine wave offset  
- Observed how characters flowed and reset  

**Credit:**

## üê¢ Assignment 4: Geometric Art with Turtle

**Prompt:**  
Create a piece using `turtle` that‚Äôs inspired by a pattern, layout, or geometric artwork. Could be something like a barcode, architectural sketch, or even a tessellation. Expand it with color, interactivity, randomness.

**Process:**  
This piece is an interactive **hexagon growth grid** ‚Äî inspired by natural structures like beehives or modular urban layouts. I used turtle to build a function that draws a hex, then connected new ones to its neighbors. It builds out from your click, but only if there's a valid neighbor to attach to. Plus I added a custom reset button at the bottom.

**What I tried:**
- Calculating hexagon positions with math  
- Making sure hexes only grow in valid adjacent spots  
- Adding randomness to fill color  
- Drawing and wiring up a real ‚ÄúRESET‚Äù button  

**Code:**

## üß¨ Assignment 6: Pok√©mon Stats Visualization

**Prompt:**  
Pick a dataset and explore it visually by asking 1‚Äì3 guiding questions. This could focus on rankings, comparisons between groups, or exploring relationships between variables.

**Dataset Chosen:**  
[`pokemon.csv`](./assignment5/pokemon.csv) ‚Äî a dataset of 800+ Pok√©mon including their types and stats like Attack, Defense, and Speed.

**Guiding Questions:**
1. **Who are the top 10 Pok√©mon by Speed?**  
2. **How does Attack vary across different Pok√©mon Types?**  
3. **Is there any visible relationship between Attack and Defense?**

**What I learned:**
- Grouping and sorting with `pandas` makes comparative visualizations really intuitive  
- Using `plotly` subplots helped combine multiple questions into one dashboard  
- Mapping Pok√©mon Types to unique colors made patterns more visually distinct  

**Visualizations included:**
- Bar chart of **Top 10 Attack Pok√©mon per Type**  
- **Scatter plot** comparing Attack vs Defense  
- **Top 10 Fastest Pok√©mon** by Speed  

**Code:**  
> You can find the full sketch [here in this repo](./mydatavis/main.py)

## üï∏Ô∏è Assignment 7: Web Scraping ‚Äî Telenovela Time

**Prompt:**  
Practice web scraping on a site you‚Äôre interested in or contains info for your research. Scrape paragraphs, headings, or images. Document your code, your process, and any errors. Save results to CSV or screenshot your image folder. Submit with your code and README.

**What I Tried First :**  
I started with a list on IMDB ‚Äî [Top Telenovelas of All Time](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls004944935/). Looked perfect, *felt* perfect‚Ä¶ until I got hit with a **504 error** (might‚Äôve been 503 tbh, trauma blocked it). After some digging (aka Googling like a maniac), I realized **IMDB doesn't allow scraping**. They‚Äôve got a whole **robots.txt** file that blocks bots like mine. I‚Äôll admit it, I got humbled by a text file. LMAO.

**What I Did Instead :**  
I pivoted to [Cosmopolitan‚Äôs telenovela list](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/news/a31651/10-best-novelas-of-all-time/) ‚Äî and boom, success. I used `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape the H2 headers (which contained the novela titles), printed them to the console, and saved them to a `.txt` file.

**Code Highlights:**
- Checks response status to avoid scraping fails  
- Uses `soup.select('h2')` to find novela titles  
- Writes scraped data to a `.txt` file for easy access

**Code:**

# üé≠ Assignment 9: Bad UI/UX ‚Äî Tkinter Disaster

**‚ú® Prompt** 
Come up with a bad UI or UX (user interface/user experience) design. Create it using tkinter 
Make sure it‚Äôs confusing, weird, annoying ‚Äî or all three. Document the process and show what makes it bad.


**üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What I Tried First**
I started simple ‚Äî using the log in page login page where the username and password fields automatically delete themselves after a few seconds.  
My goal was to take this code and make it worse.



**üîÅ What I Did Instead** 
I made a new version where:
- The input fields randomly jump around every second and a half
- Labels randomly switch between "Username" and "Password" to confuse you
- Hitting "Submit?" always says your wrong, no matter what you enter
- Inputs get erased mmediatley after you fail

Basically, it‚Äôs a chaotic guessing game ‚Äî exactly the awful experience you (don‚Äôt) want.

---

 **Code Highlights**
- Used `random.randint()` to *scramble* where the labels and input boxes appear
- Randomly swapped the label texts to mess with expectations
- Made a fake login button thatnever succeeds and clears the dats
- Added `root.after(1500, scramble_form)` so the form constantly shuffles

## üï∏Ô∏è Final Project: Stole Help
I need to be grinding on making my Thesis more effective, so all the Ideas I came up with are related to adding onto my thesis. **TRUST ME IT SUCKS**

**Potential Projects**
-  Mini Games (Mini Games)
-  Interactive Polls/Surveys
-  Sticker Drag and Drop Tool
  

1. Mini Games 
Develop a small group  simple minigames with top assets themed like something Thesis Related

Technologies: Python for the backend (Flask), HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, and basic game logic.
Assets: Simple graphics/icons (you can create these using free tools like Canva or GIMP).
Implementation Plan:

Backend:
Flask server?
recording scores?


Frontend:
Design an interactive interface using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
Phaser (for complex game logic)
Assets: Create simple graphics for buttons and backgrounds.
CSS animations and transitions to enhance user experience.?


2. Interactive Polls and Surveys
I'd Love to have some polls going around where I can maybe have even the people I  have doing the survey in the room, all the results will show up on the computer.


Backend:
Set up a Flask server to handle polling data (creating, fetching, and storing responses).
Data storage?

Frontend:
Design a poll/survey form using HTML/CSS.
JavaScript to dynamically update results without having refreshing the page (using AJAX).
Visualization: Use Chart.js for rendering poll results visually.
Style the poll/survey with CSS to make it more engaging!


3. Art/Design Customization Tool
Project Overview:
I want to have a couple backgrounds and stickers, where the user can drag and drop different graffiti peices, and make a piece to save and send to themselves. 

Technologies: HTML5 Canvas for drawing, JavaScript for interactivity.
Assets: My Pictures

Frontend:
Use HTML5 Canvas to allow users to draw and customize elements.
Implement JavaScript functions to handle drawing and customization features (colors, shapes, text).

Backend (optional):
Flask server to save user-created designs. 
Final Touches: Add visual styles, user instructions, and buttons for saving designs (use local storage if backend isn't implemented).
